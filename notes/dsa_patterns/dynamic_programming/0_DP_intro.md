# DYNAMIC Programming

DP is enhanced Recursion.

## Introduction

recursion is the parent

## Identification.

1. There will be a CHOICE to be made.(this will imply **RECURSION** )

   - If the Recursion has a Overlapping problem then DP.
   - If there is 2 call , consider for DP.

2. **Optimal solution** will be asked.

- (min, max, largest, )

## Procedure (if required )

1. Recursion
2. Memoize
3. Top-Down (problems having too many variations can be solved by using topdown directly.)

## Problems Sets - {parent questions}(basic 10 problems)

1. 0-1 Knapsack(6 variations)
   etc.....

   - subset sum.
   - Equal sum partition.
   - count of subset sum
   - minimal subset sum difference.
   - target sum property.
   - number of subset with given differnce.

2. Unbounded knapsack(5 variations)
3. Fibonacci (7 variations)
4. Longest Common Subsequence (15 variations)
5. Longest increasing subsquence (10 variations)
6. Kadane's Algorithms (6 variations)
7. Matrix chain Multiplication (7 variations)
8. DP on trees (4 variations)
9. DP on Grid (14 variations)
10. Others (5 variations)
